    <h1> People of Havas Tokyo </h1>
      <h2> Introduction </h2>
        <p> "quote about work/ getting to know people"
        </p>
        <p>
          You may know your work neighbor's name and their job title, but do you know anything else interesting about them? Like what their first アルバイト was, what phobias they have, etc?
          For some of you who didn't know, I have a bachelors degree in Psychology, so naturally, I love to observe people (not in a creepy way), and get to know them. I believe that everyone has a interesting past, and that some are unexpected and worth sharing.
          Through this blog, my mission is to feature the people of Havas Tokyo and bring light to each person's unique life story in forms of casual interviews.

              <dd> Each interview features one person. If you have any questions you would like to ask the person, please let me know :) At the end of each interview, the person will then "tag" someone, who will then be interviewed next. </dd>
